            <h4 question>How do I download the app?</h4>
            <p answer>To download the Scoot app, you can search “Scoot” in both the App
              and Google Play stores.
              An even simpler way to do it would be to click the relevant link at the
              bottom of this
              page and you&apos;ll be re-directed to the correct page.</p>

            <h4 question>Should I wear a helmet?</h4>
            <p answer>Yes, please do! All cities have different laws. But we strongly
              strongly strongly
              recommend
              always wearing a helmet regardless of the local laws. We like you and we
              want you to be as
              safe as possible while Scooting.

            <h4 question>How about the rules & regulations?</h4>
            <p answer>Now is not the time to be a rule breaker. Be sure you're complying
              with all local laws and
              regulations. Also, just be a good human being. Be sure not to park your
              Scoot where it can
              block access to buildings or get in people's way.</p>

            <h4 question>What if I damage my Scoot?
            </h4>
            <p answer>Be sure to read our terms and conditions carefully. Not the most fun
              job we know but we
              make
              it as clear as possible. There's an option to add insurance for each trip,
              or you can sign
              up for annual insurance if you're a regular Scooter.
